# Frontend Guideline Document

This guide explains the frontend setup for our Chrome extension that sends the active tab's URL to specified email addresses using the Gmail API. The document is written in everyday language to ensure everyone, irrespective of technical expertise, can understand the setup.

## Frontend Architecture

Our extension is built on a simple yet effective architecture using modern browser technologies. The key points include:

- **Languages & Environment:** We use TypeScript for type-safety along with plain JavaScript where needed. The extension is built in line with Chrome Extension Manifest V3.

- **How it Works:** When a user clicks the extension’s toolbar icon, a small menu (or popup) opens. From there, the user can either send the URL immediately or access a settings area to customize the recipient email addresses and message details.

- **Scalability & Maintenance:** Though the project is lightweight, the chosen approach makes it easy to update or expand functionality in the future. Separating the settings from the main action ensures that each part of the code remains simple and focused, making debugging and adding features easier.

## Design Principles

Even though branding and flashy designs aren’t a requirement, we adhere to design principles that make the extension intuitive and reliable:

- **Simplicity:** The interface is minimalistic. By keeping things simple, we reduce confusion—just a few clicks lead to sending the current URL via email.

- **Usability:** The design ensures that anyone can use the extension without instructions. Buttons are clearly labeled, and the settings screen is straightforward.

- **Responsiveness:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes. Whether it’s a small popup or a settings page, the interface looks good and works well on different devices.

- **Error Feedback:** While no confirmation is provided on a success, errors (like authentication issues with Gmail) are clearly communicated.

## Styling and Theming

Since the focus is on utility over aesthetics, our visual style is kept modern and flat with a touch of simplicity. Here’s the approach in detail:

- **Styling Approach:** We rely on CSS with help from a pre-processor, such as SASS, for maintainability. With methodologies like BEM (Block Element Modifier), our CSS remains organized.

- **Theming:** Although our extension doesn’t emphasize elaborate theming, we ensure consistency by sticking to a specific color palette and style across all screens. The style remains modern and flat with subtle modern touches:

  - **Color Palette:
    ▪ Primary: #4285F4 (a clean blue reminiscent of Gmail’s own design)
    ▪ Secondary: #34A853 (green for success or actionable items)
    ▪ Accent: #FBBC05 (for highlights and attention)
    ▪ Background: #FFFFFF (clean and neutral)
    ▪ Text: #202124 (dark, easy-to-read text color)**

- **Fonts:** We use a simple sans-serif font such as 'Roboto' which fits well with the material feel and modern look of the app.

## Component Structure

The extension’s UI is broken down into small, reusable components. This strategy makes it easy to handle each element independently:

- **Popup/Dropdown Components:** The toolbar icon opens a small popup menu that includes an ‘Email URL’ button and a settings option.

- **Settings Panel:** A dedicated settings component lets users enter recipient emails and customize the subject and body of the email.

- **Reusability:** By using a component-based approach, if the design needs to change, we can update a specific component without affecting the rest of the extension. This improves both maintainability and future scalability.

## State Management

State in our extension is minimal and straightforward. We manage it by:

- **Local Settings Storage:** User settings (like recipient emails and message templates) are stored in Chrome’s synchronized storage. This allows settings to automatically sync across devices without needing complex state management libraries.

- **In-Component State:** For immediate user interactions (like click events on the popup), state can be managed locally within components. This method keeps things simple and avoids overcomplicating our small project.

## Routing and Navigation

In our Chrome extension, navigation is simple and does not require a full-fledged routing library:

- **Popup-Based Navigation:** Users click the toolbar icon to open a dropdown menu where they can choose to send the URL directly or open the settings screen.

- **Switching Views:** The settings option leads the user to a separate settings view within the extension. This segregation helps keep the functionality divided and easier to manage.

## Performance Optimization

Even though our extension is lightweight, we pay attention to performance in several ways:

- **Lazy Loading:** Wherever possible, elements that aren’t frequently used (like the settings screen) are loaded only when needed. This helps keep the extension quick to launch.

- **Code Splitting:** We separate code logically so the main action (sending the email) is not slowed down by other parts of the application.

- **Asset Optimization:** All assets (like icons and basic styles) are optimized to load quickly without burdening the user’s browser.

These optimizations contribute to a smoother, quicker experience for users, ensuring that the extension responds immediately without delays.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

To ensure that our extension works reliably, we follow these testing and quality practices:

- **Unit Tests:** Wherever possible, individual pieces of functionality (such as a function that formats the email body) are tested to ensure they behave as expected.

- **Integration Tests:** We verify that different parts of the extension (like authentication and storage) work well together, ensuring a smooth overall experience.

- **End-to-End Considerations:** Although our extension is small, manual testing is an important step. We manually test the OAuth2 flow, email sending, and settings storage to catch any errors.

- **Tools:** AI tools, along with conventional testing frameworks, are used during development for generating code samples, documentation, and optimizing code where necessary.

## Conclusion and Overall Frontend Summary

In summary, our Chrome extension’s frontend is designed for simplicity, reliability, and ease of use. Key points include:

- A clean, component-based architecture with TypeScript and JavaScript ensuring a lightweight and maintainable platform.

- An interface that emphasizes clarity with a modern, flat style. The use of a standardized color palette and the Roboto font guarantee that the design is consistent and intuitive.

- Simple state management through Chrome’s synchronized storage allows settings to travel with the user, all while keeping code simplicity in mind.

- Navigation is kept straightforward with a focused popup menu and a separate settings screen, ensuring that users can quickly send URLs without getting bogged down by unnecessary steps.

- Performance is optimized through lazy loading and code splitting, which keeps the extension snappy and responsive.

This guideline document captures all aspects of the frontend—from architecture, design principles, and styling to state management, navigation, performance, and testing—ensuring that the extension meets its goals and offers a smooth, error-aware user experience.

By staying true to these guidelines, our Chrome extension remains secure, efficient, and user-friendly, while also being easy to maintain and extend as needed.
