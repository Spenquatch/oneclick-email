# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

This lightweight Chrome extension is designed to be immediately accessible when the user opens their browser. There is no extended landing page or formal sign-up process; instead, the extension is installed directly from the Chrome Web Store. When a user installs the extension, they automatically have access to the core functionality. During the first use, if the user has not provided the necessary OAuth2 credentials or is not currently authenticated with Google, the extension will initiate the Gmail OAuth2 flow in the background. This flow serves as a sign-in process to securely link the user’s Gmail account and allow the email-sending function. The process is entirely driven by Google’s secure authentication mechanism, so there is no separate account creation or sign-in screen aside from the standard Google sign-in prompt. Users are also guided by error messages that appear only when there is an issue with authentication or the sending functionality.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Since this is a Chrome extension, the main interface is not a full application dashboard but a small dropdown menu accessed by clicking on the icon in the Chrome toolbar. After clicking the extension icon, users are immediately presented with a dropdown that serves as the primary interface. This dropdown is clean and minimal, offering a large, prominent button labeled "Email URL" and an option that leads directly to the settings page for configuration. The design of the dropdown ensures that users can perform the desired action – sending the current tab's URL to a predefined email address – with just one click, all without leaving their current browsing session.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user interacts with the extension, the journey begins by clicking the extension icon in the browser toolbar. This action reveals the dropdown menu that provides access to two primary functions: the one-click email action and the settings configuration. If the user clicks on the "Email URL" button, the extension immediately retrieves the URL from the current browser tab. It then uses the Gmail API along with preconfigured OAuth2 credentials to send an email containing the URL. This entire operation occurs in the background without requiring the user to leave their current page. On the other hand, if the user selects the settings option from the dropdown, they are transitioned to a settings screen within the extension’s popup. This settings page allows the user to input multiple recipient email addresses and customize both the email subject and body. The settings are seamlessly stored using Chrome's synchronized storage, ensuring that any changes are persisted across devices. The navigation between the dropdown and the settings page is smooth and intuitive, keeping the experience straightforward and quick.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can manage their individual configurations directly through the extension’s settings screen. The settings page is designed to allow the user to update the recipient email addresses, which can include multiple contacts as needed, and to customize the subject line and content of the email. The interface is simple and requires only basic text input, streamlined to ensure that adjustments can be made easily. All the configuration settings are saved locally using Chrome storage that synchronizes across devices for consistency. After making changes, users can exit the settings screen and return back to the main dropdown interface effortlessly, resuming their workflow without interruption.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

In the event that the Gmail API or the OAuth2 authentication process encounters an issue, the extension is designed to display clear, minimal error messages directly within the interface. If the user is not signed into Gmail or if the OAuth2 process fails, an error message will inform them about the specific reason why the email could not be sent. This approach ensures that users are aware of the issue and can take corrective action, such as signing into their Google account or reviewing the OAuth2 configuration. Additionally, should there be any issues with sending the email, such as network errors or incorrect settings, the error message will appear promptly and directly so that the user understands what went wrong, thus allowing them to reattempt the action after remedial adjustments.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From start to finish, the user’s journey with this Chrome extension is streamlined and focused on efficiency. The process begins with an implicit onboarding that relies on the installation of the extension from the Chrome Web Store. Authentication is managed securely through the Gmail OAuth2 process, eliminating a traditional sign-up flow. The primary interface is a simple dropdown activated from the browser toolbar, offering a single-click solution to email the current URL. Users have the option to enter the settings screen where they can update multiple recipient addresses and customize email contents, all of which are stored locally and synced for consistency. In cases where errors occur, such as failed authentication or send actions, the extension provides clear error messages to quickly inform the user of any issues. Overall, the user experience is designed to minimize disruption and maximize productivity, ensuring that users can share their current browsing session’s URL with just a single click.
