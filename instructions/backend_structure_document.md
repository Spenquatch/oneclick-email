# Backend Structure Document

This document outlines the backend architecture for our lightweight Chrome extension that emails the current browser URL. Although the solution is predominantly client-side, careful thought has been put into the backend-like components such as OAuth2 authentication, Gmail API integration, and local synchronized storage. Below are the detailed sections:

## 1. Backend Architecture

- The extension uses a streamlined architecture, leveraging client-side OAuth2 and Gmail API integration. 
- There is no complex or dedicated server backend; the authentication and email sending processes are handled directly within the extension environment.
- Design patterns follow a modular structure, where each feature (OAuth2 handling, email sending, settings management) is encapsulated in self-contained modules.
- This minimalistic approach supports maintainability and performance by reducing overhead and dependency on external servers while still ensuring scalability as user settings and token management increase in complexity.
- Frameworks and tools used include JavaScript/TypeScript for logic, with the Chrome Extension Manifest V3 to package resources.

## 2. Database Management

- **Data Storage:** User settings such as recipient email addresses, subject, and body templates are stored in Chrome Storage in a synchronized manner across devices.
- **No Traditional Database:** Since the extension does not require history tracking or dynamic data storage, a full-fledged server database (SQL or NoSQL) is not employed.
- **Data Management Practices:** Data is structured into simple key-value pairs for easy retrieval and update, ensuring consistency and quick access.

## 3. Database Schema

Since a traditional database is not used, the data schema pertains to how Chrome Storage is organized:

- **Settings Object Structure** (human-readable):
  - Recipient Email Addresses: A list of one or more email addresses
  - Email Subject: A customizable string
  - Email Body: A customizable text field
  - OAuth2 Tokens: A secure storage object for access tokens and refresh tokens (if applicable)

If this were implemented using an SQL style, a simple table might look like:

-- Example SQL Schema (conceptual)
-- TABLE: UserSettings
-- Columns:
--   id: Primary Key (auto-generated)
--   recipients: Text (storing comma-separated email addresses)
--   subject: Text
--   body: Text
--   oauth_token: Text

But in our case, these settings are stored in Chrome's built-in synchronized storage rather than in a traditional database.

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

- **Design Approach:**
  - The extension uses RESTful API calls to interact with Google's Gmail API.
  - OAuth2 endpoints provided by Google handle authentication, token generation, and management.

- **Key API Endpoints & Their Purposes:**
  - **OAuth2 Authentication Endpoint:** Handles the authentication flow based on client credentials provided by users.
  - **Gmail API - Send Message Endpoint:** Accepts POST requests to send an email containing the current tab’s URL. The request includes the recipient list, subject, body, and authentication tokens.
  - The APIs are designed to react quickly: on clicking the button, a call is made directly to send the email, while error handling routines catch and display errors as needed.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

- **Static Hosting Within Chrome Extension:** All code and assets are packaged within the Chrome Extension, meaning they are hosted locally on the user’s browser.
- **OAuth2 and Gmail Integration:** The OAuth2 flow and Gmail API requests utilize Google’s cloud infrastructure.
  - Benefits include:
    - **Reliability:** Google's infrastructure is highly reliable and secure.
    - **Scalability:** Google can handle dynamic requests across a wide user base without performance degradation.
    - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Relying on existing cloud services minimizes any need for dedicated servers or costs associated with hosting.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

- **Core Components Include:**
  - **Chrome Extension Environment:** Hosts the UI, logic, and data storage components.
  - **OAuth2 Integration Module:** Manages secure authentication using Google’s OAuth2 endpoints.
  - **Gmail API Connector:** Facilitates communication with Gmail for sending emails.
  - **Chrome Synchronized Storage:** Acts as the local data repository for user settings.

- **Collaborative Operation:**
  - When a user clicks the one-click email button, the extension leverages the OAuth2 module to ensure the user is authenticated. 
  - The Gmail API connector then sends the email using the configured settings from Chrome Storage.
  - All communications are secured with HTTPS, and Google’s infrastructure provides robust load balancing and CDN services if needed.

## 7. Security Measures

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Implements OAuth2 to securely authenticate users with their Gmail accounts.
  - Ensures that only the necessary permissions are requested as part of the minimum required scopes.
- **Data Protection:**
  - All communications with Google APIs take place over encrypted HTTPS channels.
  - OAuth tokens are stored securely and are only used for authorized API requests.
- **Error Handling:**
  - The extension displays clear error messages for issues like authentication failures or email send errors, helping users understand and resolve issues quickly.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Monitoring Tools:
  - Built-in browser logging (using the console and Chrome's developer tools) to track runtime errors and API call statuses.
  - Regular checks of OAuth2 token validity to ensure a smooth automated re-authentication process when necessary.
- **Maintenance Strategies:
  - Consistent updates to match changes in the Gmail API or OAuth2 implementations provided by Google.
  - Ongoing testing and debugging using modern development tools (via IDEs like Cursor and assisted by AI code analysis) to ensure long-term reliability.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

- This backend structure is uniquely lightweight, relying on the Chrome Extensions environment and external APIs to provide core functionality without a complex server backend.
- The solution leverages robust industry standards for authentication, efficient client-side storage, and direct interaction with dependable cloud services (Google's OAuth2 and Gmail APIs).
- By keeping the architecture simple and modular, the extension ensures high performance, maintainability, and user-focus, aligning with the project’s goal of a one-click URL email feature.
- Key differentiators include minimal overhead, secure API integrations, and seamless synchronization of user settings across devices, positioning this project uniquely compared to more traditional email-sending extensions.

This Backend Structure Document is intended to provide a clear understanding of the backend setup, ensuring that all stakeholders, regardless of technical background, can appreciate the simplicity and effectiveness of the system design.
