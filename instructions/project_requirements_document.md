# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to boost productivity by allowing users to quickly send the URL of their current tab to one or more predefined email addresses with a single click. Instead of having to manually copy the URL and open an email client, users simply click on the extension icon in their Chrome toolbar, which reveals a dropdown with an “Email URL” button. When clicked, the extension leverages the Gmail API, using an OAuth2 authentication flow provided by the user’s own credentials to send the URL instantly via email.

The primary goal of this extension is to streamline the process of sharing links, making it as efficient and user-friendly as possible. It is being built to meet the need for a simple, one-click solution for sending links via email. Success for this project will be measured by ease-of-use, reliability in sending emails, and the secure handling of user data via OAuth2, with errors clearly communicated when something goes wrong.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   Development of a lightweight Chrome extension using Manifest V3.

*   Implementation of a one-click functionality to capture and email the current browser tab URL.

*   Integration with the Gmail API using OAuth2 authentication (client credentials provided by the user).

*   A dropdown interface that appears upon clicking the extension icon, featuring:

    *   A primary “Email URL” button.
    *   A Settings option.

*   A settings panel where users can:

    *   Configure one or more recipient email addresses.
    *   Customize the subject line and body of the email.

*   Local data storage using Chrome synchronized storage to persist settings across devices.

*   Error messaging system that clearly informs users when an action cannot be performed (such as OAuth2 failure or not being signed into Gmail).

### Out-of-Scope

*   Development or management of any complex backend system outside of OAuth2 for e-mail authentication.
*   Implementation of a history log for sent URLs.
*   Extra user notifications beyond error messages (no confirmation messages on success).
*   Any branding or design guidelines beyond a simple, intuitive interface.
*   Localization or accessibility enhancements beyond basic functionality.
*   Additional advanced features such as complex analytics or reporting on URL sends.

## 3. User Flow

When a user opens the Chrome browser on any webpage, they will notice the extension icon in the toolbar. Once the user clicks the icon, a dropdown menu appears, presenting a simple interface with a prominent button labeled “Email URL” and an option to access settings. The user interacts with the dropdown to perform the primary function of emailing the current tab’s URL, all without disrupting their browsing session.

If the user decides to adjust settings, they can click the settings option in the dropdown which navigates to a dedicated settings screen. On this screen, the user can configure one or more recipient email addresses and customize the subject line and body text of the outgoing email. Once the settings are saved using Chrome synchronized storage, these configurations ensure that future URL emails reflect the user’s preferences. If an error occurs—like failing authentication or if the user is not logged into Gmail—a clear error message is displayed to guide the user on what went wrong.

## 4. Core Features

*   **One-Click URL Emailing:**

    *   Allows users to capture the URL of the current tab and email it instantly with one click.

*   **Dropdown Menu Interface:**

    *   A minimal dropdown displays the “Email URL” button and a settings option when the extension icon is clicked.

*   **Gmail API Integration & OAuth2 Authentication:**

    *   Uses the Gmail API to send emails.
    *   Implements OAuth2 authentication for secure access, with client credentials provided by the user.

*   **Customizable Settings Panel:**

    *   Enables users to configure one or more recipient email addresses.
    *   Allows customization of the email subject line and body.
    *   Stores settings locally using Chrome storage synchronized across devices.

*   **Multiple Recipient Support:**

    *   Allows specifying more than one recipient for the email.

*   **Minimal Error Feedback:**

    *   Displays clear error messages only when issues occur (e.g., authentication or send failures).

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend:**

    *   Languages: TypeScript and JavaScript.
    *   Platform: Chrome Extension using Manifest V3 to manage permissions and functionalities.

*   **Email Integration:**

    *   Gmail API for sending emails securely.

*   **Backend/Authentication:**

    *   OAuth2 flow for secure Gmail API access (client credentials will be provided by the user).

*   **Data Storage:**

    *   Chrome Storage for saving and synchronizing user settings (recipient addresses, subject, and body).

*   **AI and Code Assistance Tools:**

    *   Tools such as GPT 4o, GPT o1, GPT o3-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Gemini 2.0 Flash can be utilized during development for code generation, documentation, and ensuring best practices.
    *   IDE integrations like Cursor may assist with advanced coding suggestions.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   The extension should retrieve the URL and trigger email sending quickly, ideally within 1-2 seconds under normal network conditions.

*   **Security:**

    *   Strict implementation of OAuth2 to secure user Gmail data.
    *   Minimal permissions requested – only those necessary for accessing the current tab's URL and initiating the Gmail API call.
    *   Clear error messaging for authentication or API failures.

*   **Usability:**

    *   A simple and intuitive dropdown interface that does not disrupt browsing.
    *   Settings interface that is straightforward, with local storage synchronization to maintain consistency across devices.

*   **Reliability:**

    *   Robust error handling to manage cases where Gmail authentication fails or the email cannot be sent.
    *   The extension should gracefully handle unforeseen issues by displaying an informative error message.

*   **Compliance:**

    *   Ensure that the extension adheres to Google’s guidelines for Chrome extensions and OAuth2 authentication methods.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The extension relies entirely on the availability and correct implementation of the Gmail API and OAuth2 flow.
*   It is assumed that the user will provide their own OAuth2 client credentials for Gmail API integration.
*   No complex backend is required; the focus is on frontend interactions and local storage.
*   The development does not account for real-time multi-user synchronization or backend data processing beyond Chrome storage.
*   The extension will only notify users of errors and remain silent when the email is sent successfully.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits and Quotas:**

    *   The Gmail API has rate limits that may affect the sending of emails if overused. It is important to implement checks or handle rate-limit errors gracefully.

*   **OAuth2 Flow Complexity:**

    *   Proper integration of the OAuth2 process is critical. Any mishandling could lead to security vulnerabilities or frequent authentication failures.
    *   Clear error messaging is needed in the event that the OAuth2 process fails (for example, if the user is not logged into Gmail).

*   **Chrome Extension Permissions:**

    *   The extension must request only the minimal necessary permissions. Over-requesting may lead to user distrust or potential rejections by the Chrome Web Store.

*   **User Settings Synchronization:**

    *   Although Chrome storage synchronization is robust, there could be edge cases where settings do not update promptly across devices. Testing for these scenarios should be conducted.

*   **Error Handling:**

    *   In case of network issues or Gmail API downtime, users should receive a clear error message indicating the nature of the issue to avoid confusion.
